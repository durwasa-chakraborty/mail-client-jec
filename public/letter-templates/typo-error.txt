Apropos to the above subject, I would like to mention that the email that I received on the <date> has been spelled incorrectly. It can be a manual error or a worse scenario can be that the official records might have an incorrect entry of my name. According to the official document issued by the government my name is <correct name>.

I would request to please look into this matter urgently and in case I need to bring my document(s) to verify for the same please notify me via my email address.

Thanking you 
-Regards
