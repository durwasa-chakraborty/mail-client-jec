Apropos to the above subject, I would like to mention that the official identity card issued by the esteemed institute has been misplaced by me. It is in my knowledge that the absence of the official identity card issued by the esteemed institute will authorize the adminstrative bodies to debar me from taking part in the campus drive.

I would like to know if there is (are) any alternative(s) or formalities with which I can take part in the campus drive.

I would be extremely greateful if my issue has been dealt with immediate attention. I would request you to please notify me through my email address mentioned below.

Thanking you 
-Regards
